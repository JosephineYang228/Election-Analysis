# Election-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is designed to demonstrate election information for the Colorado Board, which including following tasks:

1. Calculate total votes of election.
2. List all the candidates and calculate the votes they received respectively.
3. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
4. Determine the winner.
5. List all the counties in Colorado Board and determine the distribution of votes.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.10(64-bit), Visual Studio Code 1.62

## Summary
The analysis of the election shows that:
- There were 369711 vote cast in the election.
- The candidates and their results were: 
  - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
  - Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
  - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
- The winner of the election was Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
- The counties and their results were:
  - Jefferson:10.5%(38,855)
  - Denver:82.8%(306,055)
  - Arapahoe:6.7%(24,801)
- The largest county turnout was Denver, which provided 82.8% of the vote and 306,055 number of votes.
## Challenge Overview
The most challenge thing I found during this work was the "level". I must be careful to count which level my loop or command shoud be placed, and keep patient to check whenever it reports "error". I feel I am nearly blind when I am debuging the code, but finally I think I made it.

## Challenge Summary
In a word, more practice should be required for python coding. I believe this is the only way to deal with the challenge for this module.
